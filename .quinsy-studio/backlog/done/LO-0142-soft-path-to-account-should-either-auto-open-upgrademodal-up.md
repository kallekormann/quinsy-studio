## Target
General rule lives in `studio-library/ui/components/` so the next project cannot repeat this. No client / product names in studio HQ titles or infused body (provenance `--source` / CHANGELOG only).

## Scope
Kind `ui-component`. Promote or author in `studio-library/ui/components/` using `knowledge-base/atomic-design-playbook.md`. Principle title must stay product-agnostic. Train skills: ['UX-005', 'FE-002', 'SO-001']. Observation (provenance): Soft-path to Account should either auto-open UpgradeModal (`?upgrade=1`) or land scrolled to a clear Free + Upgrade row

## AC
- Inbox item LO-0142 generalized into `studio-library/ui/components/` (or matching playbook/skill/package)
- Infused text passes portability gate (no project folder names outside provenance)
- CHANGELOG.md updated
- LO moved to backlog/done/
