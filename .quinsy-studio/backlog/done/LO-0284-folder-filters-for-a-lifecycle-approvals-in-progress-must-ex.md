## Target
General rule lives in `process/` so the next project cannot repeat this. No client / product names in studio HQ titles or infused body (provenance `--source` / CHANGELOG only).

## Scope
Kind `process`. Promote or author in `process/` using `process/learning-loop.md`. Principle title must stay product-agnostic. Train skills: none (playbook-only). Observation (provenance): Folder filters for a lifecycle (approvals, in progress) must exclude dismissed items, not only the Dismissed folder itself.

## AC
- Inbox item LO-0284 generalized into `process/` (or matching playbook/skill/package)
- Infused text passes portability gate (no project folder names outside provenance)
- CHANGELOG.md updated
- LO moved to backlog/done/

## Done
Infused dismissed-exclusion on `knowledge-base/backend_playbook.md`.
